# 196-Problem
Several python programs used to research Lychrel numbers.

A Lychrel number is a natural number that cannot form a palindrome through algorithm of reversing its digits and summing the resulting numbers. This algorithm, often known as the reverse-add algorithm or 196 algorithm, is so named because 196 is the first natural number that does not seem to ever form a palindrome. As an example of this algorithm, 17 + 71 = 88, which is a palindrome. However, with 196 we get 196 + 691 = 887, 887 + 788 = 1675, and so on. 

This project is the culmination of a senior capstone research assignment for my unsolved problems in number theory course. Since this was a school project, the documentation is not entirely complete. The final paper is 196_problem.docx, and the rest of the python scripts were used to create the plots and data found in the paper.
